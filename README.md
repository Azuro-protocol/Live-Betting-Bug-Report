# Live Betting Incentivized Testnet 🏆

## Objective
Help us identify and resolve potential issues in our live betting platform by participating in targeted testing activities.

## Testing Scenarios 🧪

**How to Participate:** Engage in various test scenarios outlined below, and report your findings using our [GitHub issue form](https://github.com/Azuro-protocol/Live-Betting-Bug-Report/issues). Your insights are invaluable in helping us improve!

- **Cheat Bet:** Try placing a bet right after the outcome of an event is already known (e.g. you manage to place a bet that a goal will be scored, right after the goal has been scored already).
- **Odds Discrepancies:** Report any instances where our odds significantly differ from other platforms.
- **System Flaw Exploration:** If you find any exploitable flaws in the system, let us know.
- **Bug Patterns:** Look out for any patterns in bet acceptance, especially incorrect data or delays in transaction confirmations.
